    aboutMe:`I'm a 25 y/o belonging to the Homo sapiens species ü§£ ‚Äî a brother, a son, a friend, and a self-taught web developer and programmer. I have completed my **MCA (Master of Computer Applications)**, but my programming journey started much earlier. Back in the second year of my BSc (because my first year passed in sports üòÅ). My web development journey began with frontend development, using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and simple **JavaScript**. If you're curious about the technologies I know, here&apos;s the list: - **Python** (‚ù§Ô∏è) - **JavaScript** - Frameworks: **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS** - **MERN Stack** (Currently Learning üöÄ) Apart from coding and programming, I enjoy: - Playing **cricket** (üèè) ‚Äî because touching grass is important! - Listening to **soft music** while watching clouds drift by üò≥ - Playing mobile games like **Battle Royale** games When I&apos;m not doing any of the above. 

---
That&apos;s pretty much everything about me.
